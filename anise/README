Project ANISE
=============

ANISE stands 'A New Implemented Scripting Engine for ai5v'.

The goal of this project is to make a new interpreter for 90's Japanese adventure games made by (c)Elf and (c)Silky's.  Their games have based on the scripting engine called 'AI5V' or 'SILV'(trailing 'V' means their platform, DOS/V).

This project has been progressed on Windows platform with SDL library.  Now finally, I've managed to compile and run it on Linux platform.

If you have any questions or bugs, please visit project website.
